This is just a simple project I made for fun and to get some extra practice working with 3D and randomized terrain generation. You can run around and random terrain will generate as you do. You can also break and place blocks by clicking. The project isn't very optimized since I don't plan to do much with it, but a relatively short view distance somewhat minimizes the lag spikes.
